       "2. **Data Preparation**: Handle missing values, skewness, outliers, feature scaling/encoding, and selecting the right features.\n",
       "3. **Choosing the Right Clustering Algorithm**: Visualize the data using dimensionality reduction tools like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP to get a feel for the distribution and shape of clusters.\n",
       "4. **Evaluating Clusters**: Use visualization, evaluation metrics (e.g., Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index), and business interpretability to decide what works best for the dataset.\n",
       "5. **Interpreting Clusters**: Conduct statistical analysis, visual exploration, cluster size balance, feature-level insights, and create labels based on traits.\n",
